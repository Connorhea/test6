## About the Collection

When I graduated high school, I didn’t know what to do. I decide to pursue a business undergraduate degree because it was the subject I was best in. My understanding of marketing was limited to Billy Mays and the ShamWow guy. Like most teenagers, I had no clue what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Plunged into university, I had to quickly figure out how to navigate living on my own, then living overseas, and then surviving a global pandemic…overseas. From those experiences have come the most formative experience of my life. During my unique undergraduate program, I had the chance to obtain two degrees from two schools while gaining work experience in both Ireland and Canada all in four years. However, realizing that idea was the hard part. It was even harder when the whole world went into a lockdown and I was 5,000km away from my family. But it was in this experience that I learned why I was so lucky I did choose business. Because the world changed in a month and like every successful business, everyone had to keep moving or fall down. It was in these final years of university in Ireland where I really fell in love with business and marketing. I had courses that required me to build a business from scratch, write a 10,000-word thesis consulting with real professionals, and work with small businesses on how to improve their marketing.
